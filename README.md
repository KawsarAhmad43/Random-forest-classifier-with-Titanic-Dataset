# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for predictive modeling. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including attributes like age, gender, class, and fare. The goal is to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger survived or not.

## Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy:** 89%
- **Test Accuracy:** 83%

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and performed feature engineering.
- **Model Selection:** Utilized a Random Forest classifier due to its robustness and ability to handle various types of data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using accuracy metrics and visualized results using a confusion matrix.
